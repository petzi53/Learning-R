OpenIntro Statistics
====================

I am going to use the free material of the [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os) course to repeat the basics of statistics but by using R as programming language.

Additional material
-------------------

The textbooks comes with many additional resources:

-   [Videos](https://www.openintro.org/stat/videos.php)
-   Many Exercises at the end of the chapters: With solution of all odd-numbered in the annex. (But one can apply as teacher to get all solutions)
-   [Interactive Labs with R](https://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php)
-   Several R Packages:
    -   [openintro](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openintro/index.html): OpenIntro data sets and supplemental functions. [PDF manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openintro/openintro.pdf))
    -   [OIdata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OIdata/index.html): Data sets and supplements (OpenIntro). [PDF manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OIdata/OIdata.pdf)
    -   [oilabs](https://github.com/OpenIntroOrg/oilabs) An R package that contains the data sets, custom functions, documentation, and templates for the OpenIntro Labs.
-   [Free course on datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/statistical-inference-and-data-analysis) Data Analysis and Statistical Inference
-   Github source files to work interactively:
    -   [OpenIntro Statistics labs with base R](https://github.com/andrewpbray/oiLabs-base-R): Contentrates on base R functions and packages
    -   [OpenIntro Statistics labs with dplyr and ggplot2](https://github.com/andrewpbray/oiLabs-base-R): OpenIntro Labs in R using the dplyr and ggplot2 syntax for data manipulation.
-   [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics#courses): And last not least there is also a Coursera course specialisation (5 courses).

My learning strategy
--------------------

I plan to take the chapters in several overlapping rounds:

-   I will follow the text and experiment with the data on my own. Here I will give special attention in using function from the tidyverse-packages.
-   I will follow the text for the R labs
-   And I will complete the course on Datacamp.com.

I am not sure, if this various approaches are effective or too much of the same. But I will at least try out all of these different learning possiblities.

I will start with the [github labs tutorial](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andrewpbray/oiLabs-base-R/blob/master/intro_to_data/intro_to_data.html).

> **Attention**: I will provide "My Solutions"" of the assignments, but please keep in mind: I am learning and therefore my solutions could be inadequat or wrong.
